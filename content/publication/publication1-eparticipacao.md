abstract: "The use of ICTs (Information and Communication) as a tool for spreading democracy is a global phenomenon. Social networks mobilize thousands of people in a short time. These mobilizations have different objectives, from organizing rallies even the disclosure of petitions seeking the modification of laws. This work uses the model as a conceptual framework of pluralist (Pozzebon & Diniz, 2012), and a qualitative study seeks to understand how the e-Petition is used by the population, in a case study in Brazil. The case study took place in the city of Cascavel in 2011, where due to dissatisfaction with the increased number of councilors at City Hall was the creation of an e-Petition. As a result it can be seen that the population is favorable and adopts the technology, but the government still imposes restrictions on its use."
