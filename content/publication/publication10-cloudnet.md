title: "A Novel Method for SFC Segmentation in Edge-Cloud Environments"
year: 2024
tags: ["conference"]
event_magazine: "CloudNet"
abstract: "A Service Function Chain (SFC) is a chain of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). SFCs enable orchestration of complex network services in edge-cloud environments. To execute an SFC in a multi-domain environments, it is necessary to split the SFC into small parts named segments. This paper presents the Distributed Segmentation Strategy (DSS), a novel approach to segmenting SFCs. The SFC segmentation problem involves dividing an SFC into smaller parts to optimize the deployment and operation of network services across multiple domains. Our method allows for configurable segmentation strategies, enabling different SFC placement methods to tailor the segmentation process according to their specific requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that DSS enhances performance based on the SFC placement criteria, making it a valuable contribution to Network Function Virtualization (NFV) environments."
