abstract: "Multimedia sensors have recently become a major data source, giving rise to the Internet of Multimedia Things. Since multimedia applications are usually latency-sensitive, data processing in the cloud is not always effective. A strategy to minimize delay is to process the streams closer to the data sources, exploiting the resources at the edge of the network. We propose V-PRISM, an architecture to virtualize multimedia sensors with components deployed and executed at the edge tier. V-PRISM can reduce the resource consumption of IoT devices, the network traffic, and the end-to-end delay while increasing the ROI (Return On Investment) for infrastructure providers."
