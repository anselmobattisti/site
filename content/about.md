# About

I’m *Anselmo Luiz Éden Battisti*, **PhD in Computer Science from Fluminense Federal University (UFF)**, with research focused on Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). My academic background also includes a **Master’s in Computer Science (UFF)**, a **Master’s in Strategic Management (PUCPR)**, a specialization in Java Development (Unioeste), and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science (Unioeste)**.

I have worked as a university professor and project manager, contributing to innovation-driven initiatives and participating in national and international projects in areas such as 5G, smart cities and digital platforms. These efforts resulted in scientific publications, patents registered in the United States and market-applied solutions. 

As one of the founders of Webgenium, I have continued this journey by driving digital innovation and creating solutions that support businesses in their transformation processes, combining hands-on experience in web and digital projects with a broader vision of how technology can generate meaningful impact. This path has allowed me to bridge academic research with real-world applications, reinforcing my commitment to turning knowledge into practical, smart and effective solutions.

My work bridges research and practice, exploring how technology can transform the way we connect, process information, and innovate across different sectors.
